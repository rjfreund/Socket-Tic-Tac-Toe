Rhetorical Analysis

I do not necessarily deserve an A for this project nor for the semester. I just want to do service to those who ask of me, and school is a good practice for when I am actually helping some other people whom have genuine requests. I had the hardest time with this project not with the code, but turning it in. I turned it in on Sunday, February 20th, instead of on Friday, February 17th, because I have depression. At times, normal things are very difficult to do, even writing a simple rhetorical analysis and turning in a project. I got lucky since you, Professor Krause, sent me an email reminding me that I can turn it in over the weekend without penalty. That's about all I have to say.
